# Implicit function plotter

## Structure of the program

The program consists of two parts:
- The [backend](/backend) receives an implicit function expression in plain text, parses it, and computes its contour. It is then passed to the frontend in form of vertices and edges. The backend is written in Rust and compiled to Web Assembly for maximum performance.
- The [frontend](/src) handles user input and displays the results from the backend on HTML canvas using WebGL. It is written in TypeScript.

## Build instructions

- __Install the dependencies__:
	```
	npm install
	```
	_This should be done only once. If the process fails for some reason, delete the `node_modules` folder and start again._

- __Frontend development:__
	```
	npm run dev
	```
	_This will run Vite development server with hot module replacement._

- __Backend development:__

	You need [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/) installed and available from the terminal.

	Backend can be built using `wasm-pack build ./backend --target web` command. To watch for changes in the backend and build automatically run:
	```
	npm run dev:backend
	```
	_You can run `dev` and `dev:backend` simultaneously from two terminals._
- __Build for production:__
	```
	npm run build
	```
	_The contents of `dist` folder can than be placed on any web server._
